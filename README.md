Scientific Journals Network Project

Overview
This project analyzes scientific journal data to build a co-occurrence network representing relational information based on shared categories.
Categories are the subjects these jounrals are categorized under. 
Nodes in this network symbolize individual journals, while edges depict the connections determined by the categories each journal shares with others.

Requirements
To run this project, you will need Python installed along with the following packages:

pandas
matplotlib
networkx
flask
Please ensure these packages are installed before attempting to run the program. 

Network Graph
The journal network graph (network()) constructs nodes and edges as follows:

Nodes: Each node represents a journal title extracted from the data (journal2022.csv).
Edges: Edges are created between journals that share one or more categories. The weight of each edge signifies the number of shared categories.
A visualization (visualize()) is provided to help you see the network visually using Matplotlib. 
The visualization brings up a window displaying the network graph where each node and edge are placed based on the layout generated by networkx.

Usage
To start analyzing the journals' network, ensure you have the dataset named journal2022.csv in your working directory. 
The main function reads the first 1000 rows of this dataset, processes it, and visualizes the resulting network graph.
Run the program by executing the app.py which houses the functions to run the flask app. 

Interactions
This project has several interactions:
1. A user can input a specific category for a journal using a drop-down option. After selecting the first category, the user can proceed to view journals within this category.
2. After the first category selection, a second category selector is revealed, allowing users to click all categories that have journals within the two categories.
3. This process is repeated for the third category, allowing users to select 3 different categories to find a journal that falls under all three.
4. Next, a user can click on a specific journal to get more information.
5. A user is shown information about these articles including the url, which is fetched using an API that searches for the URL using the ISSN.
6. Users are given 3 recommended journals based off the network similarities, allowing users to explore journals with similar categories to the ones they are interested in.
